							<p class='p_content'><i>Distance education</i> and <i>distance learning</i> are definitions, which are often confused. <i>Distance learning</i> is defined as:<br><br>
							- A new form of correspondence study tied with the use of IT and multimedia. <br>
							- An acquisition of new skills and knowledge via learning with technologies at a distance. <br>
							- Another mode of study, along with conventional full-time and part-time study, on the basis of traditional and innovative methods, which include telecommunications technologies. <br>
							- A goal-oriented process of asynchronous or synchronous interaction of learners and tutors irrespective of their physical location. <br><br>
							Similarly, the term <i>distance education</i> is defined in a variety of ways since the concept <i>education</i> is more complex than <i>learning</i>: <br><br>
							- A form of education with the use of state-of-the-art tools and technologies to deliver education materials to the recipient irrespective of his/her location.<br>
                            - A set of educational services offered to the public in the educational environment on the basis of a remote information exchange. <br>
							- An educational process and system in which all or a significant proportion of the teaching is carried out by someone or something removed in space and time from the learner. <br>
							- A social and pedagogical system aimed at facilitating life-long learning of an individual in the frame of distance learning. <br><br>
							
						
							The fact that the two concepts of <i>distance education</i> and <i>distance learning</i> are viewed as issues of quite a problematic and vague definition, and considering the analysis of journals, scientific papers,  educational sources and legal documents it is suggested these two concepts are used interchangeably in the thesis.</p>
