							<p class='p_content'>It is not clear, when exactly distance education emerged in Russia. Some experts say, correspondence schools for adults appeared in the second half of the XIX century, the other opinions suggest, it was after the October revolution of 1917, when first correspondence courses of various kinds were offered to promote self-education and self-development for workers.<br><br>
							In the USSR, correspondence study became a part of higher education, was based on the print-based delivery mode and was characterized by a regular succession of remote and presence cycles.<br><br>
							The 1990s were the cradle for distance education. The 1997-2002 experiment in integrating technologies into learning was successful, it triggered issuing a number of legal acts on distance learning technologies. Three Tomsk universities made the first steps in distance learning during the 1990s.<br><br>
							The 2000s were marked as a breakthrough of information technologies in education. Today, e-learning and distance learning are widely applied in various forms of study: from schools to degree programs and continuing education.
