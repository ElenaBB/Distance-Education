							<p class='p_content'>The system of education is always in the progress, and technologies have become an integral a part of learning. <br> Distance education in Russia is constantly evolving, from the Russian Empire through the USSR to the Russian Federation, which originated as correspondence schools for workers in the Russian Empire, continued as an independent correspondence mode of study in the USSR, and went on as correspondence study with technologies in Russia nowadays.<br>
							It is highly expected, distance learning in Russia has a big potential since this process is closely tied with the development of information and communication technologies:<br><br>
							
							- There is still much geographic area left to cover with the Internet access, therefore people residing there may obtain on-line learning opportunities.<br>
							- The potential to be used at schools, especially for the children with special needs.<br><br>
							However, there is a number of hurdles:<br>
							- Low "technoliteracy."<br>
							- Distance learning is officially not a separate mode of study. Only distance learning technologies are permitted to be be utilized in three main modes of study.<br>
							-Shortage of technologically competent educators.<br><br>
							It is believed, a large number of the universities in Russia have a solid background to promote the concept of distance education at various levels: from educational management to the infrastructure. The trend that universities unite and organize networks and consortia is said to facilitate the idea of learning at a distance, overcome difficulties together and contribute to the development of on-line learning in Russia and, consequently, globally.
